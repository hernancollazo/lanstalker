# LANStalker

**LANStalker** is a lightweight network monitoring tool that continuously scans your local network for active hosts, tracks their IP/MAC assignments, and displays results through a web interface. It uses Nmap under the hood for detection and integrates with a SQLite database to persist host data over time.

---

## üß© Features

- Passive and active discovery of LAN hosts via Nmap.
- Tracks MAC addresses as unique identifiers (even if IP changes).
- Stores host info (IP, MAC, hostname, OS, vendor) and open ports.
- Detects new devices and changes in IP addresses.
- Web dashboard to browse hosts, view port details, edit comments, and review changelogs.
- Dockerized setup with separate containers for scanner and web interface.
